# YouTube Channel Marker

A lightweight browser extension that lets you mark YouTube channels
so you can easily recognize them while scrolling the home page.

## Features
- ⭐ Click-to-mark channels
- Persistent highlighting
- Works with infinite scroll
- No API keys required
- No tracking

## Why?
YouTube does not reliably expose subscription data on the home page.
This extension gives users full control instead.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Open chrome://extensions
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Load unpacked → select folder
